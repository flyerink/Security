# Cerberus RFCs

Proposals for improving the Cerberus specifications are handled through the RFC process. An RFC describes a problem with the protocol as it exists today and proposes a solution.

Unlike IETF RFCs, Cerberus RFCs are non-normative, and primarily exist to record discussions leading to particular design decisions in the protocol, and to provide a starting point for deciding whether to adopt a proposal.

## Creating an RFC

Creating an RFC is done as follows:
1. Pick a name for the RFC, say, "My Cool Proposal".
2. Find the next RFC number in the sequence, say, 0284, and copy the template file into `0284-My_Cool_Proposal.md`.
3. Fill out the template as described, except for the PR link.
4. Open a PR to add your RFC to the repo, and modify the text to include the PR link (this is so that there is an easy way to find the discussion of the proposal for future readers of the proposal itself).
5. Discuss!

## Accepting and implementing an RFC

An RFC is accepted when its PR is approved and merged by a specification owner.

When and whether to accept an RFC is at the owners' discretion, but will usually occur after some discussion of the RFC has occured on the PR.

After the RFC is merged, the author may *implement* it by submitting a PR making text modifications to the spec(s) relevant to the RFC; in principle, the only thing up for discussion at this point should be the precise wording of the change.

The current RFC owners are:
* bryankel
* chweimer
